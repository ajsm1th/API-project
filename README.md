I chose the XMysql (https://github.com/o1lab/xmysql/Links to an external site.) to work with because I already had a MySQL database from a previous class.  I have attached the screenshots also.  I followed the directions from the link, which I have also listed below.  This did not require me to create any code.

Setup and Usage
xmysql requires node >= 7.6.0

npm install -g xmysql
xmysql -h localhost -u mysqlUsername -p mysqlPassword -d databaseName
http://localhost:3000
